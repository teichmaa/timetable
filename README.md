# Timetable

Time table generator (solver) written in Haskell

## Getting Started

All you nedd is a Haskel compiler, for example GHC. See http://learnyouahaskell.com/introduction#what-you-need for more details.

## Examples

You can find input examples in the source file, and some more in `examples.md`. `examples.md` is also great source for test-input.

## Deployment

Just run the `timetable.hs` using GHC or GHCI.

To learn more information about input and output, see `input.md`

## Versioning

Currently not supported. The `timetable.hs` is self contained and without dependencies.
